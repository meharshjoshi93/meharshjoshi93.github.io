They painted. Not all men are same, not all men are Picasso. But still, they painted. A lot has changed over the course of our destiny, over the course of our journey; as a specie. However, even today, we paint. How? that part has eveloved. What? Yeah well, that shit changes by the hour. Why? This part, it’s debateable.</p> <p>You see, we are story tellers. We have this animalistic, primal, innane need to tell stories. Be it in words, art, music, movies, games, or whatever. We are visual beings. And .. we are all, story tellers. Not all of us are lucky enough though. Most of us live our lives denying this very fundamental truth, the ones that don’t are still looking for their story to tell. Some, get to tell the story they want. The lucky ones.</p> <p>I think, I too have a story to tell .. maybe.</p> <p>Today, I was back in the city I love, Dehradun. Back in the Electronics Department of DIT. The place where it all started, apparently. You see, I was a madman of sorts. I still am (I REALLY AM), but thats not the point right now. I used to spend hours mulling over problems somewhere between AI, IoT, Life, College, Love, Survival and a Dream. I spent most of them with my best friends. My mentor &amp; my laptop (yeah, a nerd, boo, I GET IT, can it!). 4 years. 4 most influential &amp; concious years. 4 years of my life. I spent doing that.</p> <p>After which I went to Lucknow, to help another mentor of mine, solve the land crisis for farmers. The farmers, who were killing themselves, just because the land was barren from salinization (hectares of land barren, why? because salt deposited on top)</p> <blockquote> <p>Okay, before I tell you anything more, just know that all that’s there is, in engineering, is; READ, WRITE &amp; MOVE. Be it a state, memory, signal, current, heat, motion or object. How, what, why, where, when and scale vary. But in the end of the day, it’s READ, WRITE &amp; MOVE.</p> </blockquote> <p>So I engineered solution to that problem with the help fo my mentor &amp; friends. Lo and behold, land was desalanised. Done. But above all, we saved lives. We CHANGED lives. Soon (I mean a year later), I got a call from Smart Joules. So I joined the team. I was going to save the energy for the planet. I was going to resolve the energy crisis. A year later. Deployed a suite of technology products that actually helped reduce upto 40% energy consumption in commercial buildings. Once you understand your problem and you have sweated your life away with the tools of trade. It’s just READ, WRITE &amp; MOVE. Nothing was ever straight forward, but I came trhough, eventually. (Oh, BTW, life happened in betwen. Love, hate, betrayal, failure, success. The usuals. Life doesn’t just stop because you are on a mision)</p> <p>I mean, thats something right? At least I was on the track. I have been fascinated by complex &amp; non linear systems for as long as I can remember. I like that. But more, so I love solving their problems. That’s what got me into systems design and AI. So, long story short, jargons aside .. my story seems to be story of finding problems that speak to me and using technology to solve it. In wasys that have an impact on countless lives. At least, that’s what is apparent from what I wrote. Yeah, well .. not really.</p> <p>I am back in the department, to hire future me. I am here to help future me. I am here to meet an old friend. My mentor. I am here, because the cycle that I thought was long over, has only just begun. I am here because I just discovered what story I have to tell.</p> <blockquote> <p>It’s a story of change. It’s a story of redemption. It’s a story about communicating my story to 100 potential me’s to an effect that 1 future me, ends up being a better me. It’s a story of something bigger that me. A better me that ends up finishing what I started. A change.</p> </blockquote> <p>It’s the story that I realised just about now, and the story that the universe knew all along. It’s the story that all these young mind &amp; educators alike, heard. And … it’s only just begining.</p> <p><strong>So, what’s your story?</strong></p> <aside class="share"> <p>If you liked this article and think others should read it, please <a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=What is your story ?&amp;url=https://joshi-harsh.github.io/2018/what-is-your-story/&amp;via=me_harsh_joshi" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'twitter-share', 'width=550,height=235');return false;">share it on Twitter <i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#00aced"></i></a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://joshi-harsh.github.io/2018/what-is-your-story/" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'facebook-share', 'width=550,height=235');return false;">Facebook <i class="fa fa-facebook-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#3b5998"></i></a>.</p> </aside> </div> </article> <aside id="comments" class="disqus"> <div class="container"> <h3><i class="icon icon-comments-o"></i> Comments</h3> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script type="text/javascript"> var disqus_shortname = 'joshi-harsh-github-io'; var disqus_identifier = '/2018/what-is-your-story'; var disqus_title = 'What is your story ?'; var disqus_url = 'http://localhost:4000'; /*var disqus_developer = 1;*/ (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); </script> <noscript> Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a> </noscript> </div> </aside> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <small class="block">Minimalist Theme by <strong>Harsh Joshi</strong>. | Inspired by &lt;/&gt; <a href="http://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace" title="a minimalist Jekyll theme for technical writing">Thinkspace theme</a> by <a href="http://heiswayi.github.io">Heiswayi Nrird</a>. | <i class="fa fa-copyright"></i> 2018 Harsh Joshi</small> </div> </footer> </main> </body> </html>
