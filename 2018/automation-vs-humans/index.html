Number of lines of code of Python &amp; C++ that I used to write are now replaced by lines in documents &amp; emails … and post-its. Balancing the C-Suites &amp; Team synergy and getting the product out. Incremental development &amp; course corrections. But an undrlying vision &amp; direction for the development none the less. Come to think about it, I still do a ton of programming. Systems programming. But I feel like I am programming my team &amp; the product as a whole, as opposed to the IoT &amp; ML systems &amp; services. Python &amp; C++ is now Hindi &amp; English .. and Maths. Class diagrams are now scrum boards and so on. I mean, yeah, I do get my hands dirty occasionally with the raw code but that’s about the time of merge conflicts with development branches. Architecture &amp; Timeline is my primary concern now.</p> <p>But you see, this is an interesting time. 100% of leading a team is, 50% staying on track (which means knowing what to say NO to as opposed to saying a default YES), 20% planning, 30% making course corrections. Staying on track is essentially following a constrained &amp; bounded development policy, strategy &amp; guidelines. It’s realy easy to get lost in the world of tech. Staying focussed &amp; disciplined is the key. Kinda like following a constitution. And as I was toying with the idea, it occoured to me, what if the constitution can be programmed?</p> <blockquote> <p>Well, let us suppose, there existed a magical way to program the constitution. Not just that, but the same magical way, lended support to tracking, incentivizing and penalizing the citizens. Ooh, and, AND, <strong>and</strong> .. this very magical technique that helped us program, observe and execute the constitution, could also help evlove and improve the very constitution it self. Now, THATs something. Isn’t it?</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Now lets extend this analogy out to an organization. The organizational constitution and its execution is essentially how the company runs. However we missed a core element in constitution of nation which may not seem obvious when thinking of nation but is kind of a big deal when thinking of organization, planning of projects! Which is basically what the company DOES when its RUNNING. Right? Thats what government and their policies do for the nation, you get idea , blah blah blah .. civics always bored me :/</p> </blockquote> <p>Now going back to our core concept of making it programmagble. If this whole thing can be automated, what would be the job of a manager? huh? Manager, at its very essence is the automation program. Top level management runs the company (the constitution) and middle level management essentially runs the project (the government). I mean yeah, the political science guys or just about anyone can find about a zillion things wrong with this analogy but you get the idea, right? A program doesn’t have any bias, it looks at the observations effectively, no discrimination, no bias, no lobbying, just facts. The better and objective the algorithm, the better the objectivity and fairness. The better the quality of data it is trained on (oh yeah, its an artificially intelligent program), more precise it is. It’s upto the programmer now to tweak the model and there you have it. Now add to this program the capability to involve some sort of consensus algorithm and you have a majority voting architecture to upgrade the very rules that govern the system. Thats not necesarily a good thing if the citizens are all heathens but then you can have some sort of weightage and veto in the constitution to some founding principles for consensus and you can circumvent that problem. Its simple, not easy, but yeah, its simple.</p> <p>If we tried hard enough and spent enough time thinking about it, we can come with a model for entire country and not just organization but lets just stick to the organization for now, shall we?</p> <p>Throw in IoT and some modifications into the core constitution of governance for accountability and you have a product manager that does 100% of the job (staying on track, planning and making course correction) with a very flexible and infinitely scalable team (theorectically) and culture. Well, thats all theoretical for now, but IoT , AI and Blockchain combined, have the power to revolutionize the product management, if not for top management then at the least for middle managment in the coming decade. Sure there are a lot of kinks to work out. I mean, the first transistor at the bell lab was a hideous monstrosity and now you have like a trillion of them in the processor of your phone. All in what 20 years of fine tuning? You see my friend, <strong>objects in the mirror are closer than they appear</strong>. My only advice, ADAPT. Because a revolution is coming, it’ll wipe out old models and replace them with new ones, that none of us, can’t even imagine. It’s not a linear growth and 10 year, is a <strong>lot</strong>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Ride the wave, hide from it or be swiped away, is upto you! I’d rather surf :)</p> </blockquote> <aside class="share"> <p>If you liked this article and think others should read it, please <a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Automation Vs Humans&amp;url=https://joshi-harsh.github.io/2018/automation-vs-humans/&amp;via=me_harsh_joshi" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'twitter-share', 'width=550,height=235');return false;">share it on Twitter <i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#00aced"></i></a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://joshi-harsh.github.io/2018/automation-vs-humans/" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'facebook-share', 'width=550,height=235');return false;">Facebook <i class="fa fa-facebook-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#3b5998"></i></a>.</p> </aside> </div> </article> <aside id="comments" class="disqus"> <div class="container"> <h3><i class="icon icon-comments-o"></i> Comments</h3> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script type="text/javascript"> var disqus_shortname = 'joshi-harsh-github-io'; var disqus_identifier = '/2018/automation-vs-humans'; var disqus_title = 'Automation Vs Humans'; var disqus_url = 'http://localhost:4000'; /*var disqus_developer = 1;*/ (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); </script> <noscript> Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a> </noscript> </div> </aside> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <small class="block">Minimalist Theme by <strong>Harsh Joshi</strong>. | Inspired by &lt;/&gt; <a href="http://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace" title="a minimalist Jekyll theme for technical writing">Thinkspace theme</a> by <a href="http://heiswayi.github.io">Heiswayi Nrird</a>. | <i class="fa fa-copyright"></i> 2018 Harsh Joshi</small> </div> </footer> </main> </body> </html>
