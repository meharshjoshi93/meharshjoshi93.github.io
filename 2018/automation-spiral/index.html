Last time we discussed how the very <a href="https://joshi-harsh.github.io/2018/evolution-of-communication/">architecture of communication is evolving</a>. And evolving fast, at that. Today, lets take a dive into the engineering that goes behind it. So this is something, that I often talk about a lot, with my friends, fellow nerds/geeks/developers/aliens/rockstars/sages/gods…Yeah, that escalated quickly!</p> <p>I rememeber back in 2002 or something near about. I was in class 6th. Didn’t know shit about computers or what they are supposed to do, other than the fact that my cousin got one and hers was the only placed I preferred to go because of the stupid (not so stupid, awesome!) games that I got to play on it. Next year, I had a test in computer language ‘BASIC’. That’s when it all started. Had to create a pattern of ‘*’, the hello world of for loops in any noob course of programming. The output felt so damn cool. It felt nothing less than being a God. Next year, I had the best and most bad ass computer teacher I ever had. Miss Arpita Samson. Holy shit! She scared the living .. out of everyone in our class. Strict AF. But any one of us who knew her and made something even half decent out of themself, owe it to her and her (albeit, super unorthodox) teaching methods. Anyways, nostalgia aside, class 8th was my summer of reckoning. I learnt HTML, CSS &amp; JS. The good old days of Java Script, where Node.JS was not a thing and ‘Python’ for me was still a reptile. There was only one library, JQuery and thats that. Animations were the forte of Flash (and Macromedia owned it, not Adobe).</p> <p>Fast forward. By the time I was in high school, I had become comfortable making websites and got decent recognition too at that. Then I got over it and started doing some engineering. Robotics &amp; Automation. Spent good 8 years studying, developing, testing and deploying. Today I am working with a startup, Smart Joules, helping shape a scalable &amp; sustainable future for us all by using IoT &amp; AI to save energy consumption in commercial buildings.</p> <p>As I observe the differnce in technologies (and not just the way the communication has evolved), we are solving immensely complex problems today, than the ones I was exposed to back in those days. I had never generated a website that compiled itself. Nope. But here we use, Node.JS and Python, extensively. AWS, thats a thing in it’s own league. The way infrastructure scaling and the code generation is, automated, is a work of pure art. Yes, art! I mean, think of it, the code that is rendered in your browser, even as you read in this blog, is not what I wrote. I wrote code to generate this blog. The blog generated itself on compile time, when I enterd “jekyl serve” and the blog post code got released as I pushed my github commit. The cloud scaling and everythng for running millions of repositories like Joshi-Harsh on Github, is a sophestication of its own. Take AWS for example, the CICD pipelines, the Elastic Load balancers and God knows all the sorcery that those (very bright) folks have been cooking up, It’s just insane. I mean once you know and get used to it all and the beast that lies underneath the princess that a UI is, YOU CAN’T GO BACK.</p> <p>Makes you wonder, the automation revolution that’s preceding the intelligence revolution that’s yet to come, is a spiral that’s fueling it’s very own development and the developmnet is a spiral thats just helping develop faster, better and smarter. And for the most part, I am in awe of this beauty that we have collectively created! You just need to unfocus and soak it all in .. it’ll come to you, and then .. you won’t go back!</p> <aside class="share"> <p>If you liked this article and think others should read it, please <a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Automation Spiral&amp;url=https://joshi-harsh.github.io/2018/automation-spiral/&amp;via=me_harsh_joshi" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'twitter-share', 'width=550,height=235');return false;">share it on Twitter <i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#00aced"></i></a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://joshi-harsh.github.io/2018/automation-spiral/" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'facebook-share', 'width=550,height=235');return false;">Facebook <i class="fa fa-facebook-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#3b5998"></i></a>.</p> </aside> </div> </article> <aside id="comments" class="disqus"> <div class="container"> <h3><i class="icon icon-comments-o"></i> Comments</h3> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script type="text/javascript"> var disqus_shortname = 'joshi-harsh-github-io'; var disqus_identifier = '/2018/automation-spiral'; var disqus_title = 'Automation Spiral'; var disqus_url = 'http://localhost:4000'; /*var disqus_developer = 1;*/ (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); </script> <noscript> Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a> </noscript> </div> </aside> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <small class="block">Minimalist Theme by <strong>Harsh Joshi</strong>. | Inspired by &lt;/&gt; <a href="http://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace" title="a minimalist Jekyll theme for technical writing">Thinkspace theme</a> by <a href="http://heiswayi.github.io">Heiswayi Nrird</a>. | <i class="fa fa-copyright"></i> 2018 Harsh Joshi</small> </div> </footer> </main> </body> </html>
