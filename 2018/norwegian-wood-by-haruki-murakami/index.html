Well, I felt it. Every part of it. Never have I felt so vulenrable and heart broken while reading something. Writing a review for this one (or any book as a matter of fact), and not spioling it, is a challenge. It’s more challenging with fiction as opposed to non-fiction (which BTW, is my staple). Yeah I know, non-fiction have nothing to spoil but still. Catch the drift, will ya! <br /></p> <p>A quick google search will tell you the following about it’s genre/summary/plot:</p> <blockquote> <p>A bildungsroman is a genre of literature that often begins with the story’s protagonist experiencing an emotional loss and then achieving gradual maturity or growth as an individual. Murakami’s Norwegian Wood is a good example of this genre.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>This story explores the formative years of the main character, taking us through his painful disappointments, psychological development and moral education before ending with a… (don’t worry I am not giving spoilers)</p> </blockquote> <p>If you <em>have</em> read it, then you could argue about what the ending really meant? (Some Nolan shit right there and the friggin top keeps spinning) Though I accept the morbid possibility but I’d rather chose the one which isn’t. Again, you gotta read it to understand. The weird thing is, as I read the story Murakami was trying to tell .. it triggered some memories from the past. Things that I had forgotten, smells that I cherished once, the favourite laugh, the favourite walk, the favourite rain and a whole lot of it. Not all of it was bad. To be honest, he handled his cripling depression, <em>way</em> better than I ever did. But again, just like most literature, it’s not what the story was about, but how it was told. For example, take the way he described how <em>Watanabe</em> felt as he observed Naoko ..</p> <blockquote> <p>… as if she had been hiding in somelong, narrow space until she herself had become long and narrow …</p> </blockquote> <p>I am sure you’ll find all that and a lot more when you read it. It’s a story written in the time of turmoil. The political turmoil and student uprisings in 1960’s Japan. Turmoil within. It’s a story about love and loss. But I felt that the story of loss was told from two point of views. The point of view of hanging on, and the one of letting go. It’s indeed a beauty. A must read.</p> <p>I don’t read fiction a lot and I was guilt tripped into reading this one. This was also, my first Murakami experience, and boy, do I love it! It was gifted to me by an exceptionally talented and a very special (dork) friend, Kartika. She runs a bookstagram account by the name of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kittyreadsandquotes">kittyreadsandquotes</a> and embaresses herself on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYGOySQ4aZp_r_z2bD7s05A">youtube</a> as well by the same name. Like, share, comment .. (<strong>Don’t</strong>, why would you taint your feed with that!? WHY? <em>WHY?</em>)</p> <p><br /> You can buy <a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0099448823/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=harshjoshiblo-21&amp;creative=24630&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0099448823&amp;linkId=966f594502eb166c7f5da0fce3ebceff">this book</a> on Amazon, if you dont already own it. Or maybe you wanna gift it to someone (BTW, dont if the person is depressed, you’ll kill that poor soul and it’ll be on you). Next on my Murakami to-read list is <a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0099458322/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=harshjoshiblo-21&amp;creative=24630&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0099458322&amp;linkId=c6df267d67232aede9b25fc0d31980dc">Kafka on the shores.</a></p> <p>They also made a movie out of it. If you are one of those people who’d rather watch a movie .. I get it (doesn’t mean <strong>I</strong> don’t <strong>judge you</strong>, but yeah, I get it). I haven’t watched it yet, so I donn’t really know if they butchered it or if they butchered it. I mean come on, thats what they always do with the movies.
